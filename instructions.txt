🧰 Project: Contact Manager CLI (Text-based)
📦 What You'll Build
A command-line tool to manage contacts (name + age), stored in a JSON file.

🧠 Concepts You'll Practice:
Reading user input

Structs & slices

File I/O

JSON encoding/decoding

Looping and simple menu system

🧑‍💻 Assignment: Contact Manager v1
✅ Features to Implement
Main Menu

pgsql
Copy
Edit
1. Add new contact
2. List all contacts
3. Exit
Adding a contact

Prompt user for name and age

Append to a slice of Person

Save to JSON file

Listing contacts

Load from JSON file

Display each contact

🧱 Struct
go
Copy
Edit
type Person struct {
    Name string `json:"name"`
    Age  int    `json:"age"`
}
📂 File
Save contacts in: contacts.json

🚦Flow Summary
Load existing contacts.json into []Person

Show menu (loop until user exits)

Based on input, either:

Add → prompt + append + save to file

List → print each name + age

Exit → end program

🤖 Hints
Use bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin) + reader.ReadString('\n') for string input.

Use strconv.Atoi to convert string to int.

Create helper functions:

go
Copy
Edit
func loadContacts() []Person
func saveContacts([]Person)
⏭️ Your Task
Build the first version with:

Menu system

Add contact

List contacts

Once you’ve got that, I’ll review it and we can add search, delete, update, and even tag-based filtering in v2.
